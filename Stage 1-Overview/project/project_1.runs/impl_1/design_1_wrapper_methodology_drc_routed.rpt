2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock  
The generated clock design_1_i/rgb2dvi_0/U0/SerialClk has a sub-optimal master source pin selection, timing can be pessimistic
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-36#1 Warning
Invalid Generated Clock due to missing edge propagation  
There is no rising/falling edge propagation between master clock axi_dynclk_0_PXL_CLK_O to generated clock design_1_i/rgb2dvi_0/U0/SerialClk
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '10' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
