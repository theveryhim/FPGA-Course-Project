## Stage 2:
In this satge, a conventional ASM structure is added along with a Scrambler. In fact,in this project
we will implement a transmitter in the PS section and a receiver in the PL section.
We use the DS/CCS header or send multiple samples as a header and wait to receive it at the receiver
to reset our Descrambler.
